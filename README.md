# Materials for Machine Learning with Ontologies

This repository contains all the materials for our "Machine learning with biomedical ontologies" manuscript. We provide the Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce our experimental results and the benchmark datasets based on predicting protein-protein interactions.
Furthermore, we make a set of slides available (as PDF and source code in LaTeX Beamer) that may be useful for teaching or presentations.

## Notebooks

We provide several [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the [notebooks](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies/tree/master/notebooks) directory. The notebooks include:

* [data.ipynb](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies/blob/master/notebooks/data.ipynb) -- data generation and preprocessing
* [semantic-similarity.ipynb](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies/blob/master/notebooks/semantic-similarity.ipynb) -- predicting protein--protein interactions using semantic similarity measures
* [onto2vec_opa2vec.ipynb](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies/blob/master/notebooks/onto2vec_opa2vec.ipynb) -- axiom embeddings using Onto2Vec and embeddings for axioms plus annotation properties using OPA2Vec
* [graph-walks.ipynb](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies/blob/master/notebooks/graph-walks.ipynb) -- embedding ontologies using random walks on graphs
* [graph-transe.ipynb](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies/blob/master/notebooks/graph-transe.ipynb) -- embedding ontologies using translating embeddings on graphs
* [elembedding.ipynb](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies/blob/master/notebooks/elembedding.ipynb) -- ontology embedding that approximates the ontology models (EL Embeddings)
