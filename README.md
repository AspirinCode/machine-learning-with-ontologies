# Materials for Machine Learning with Ontologies

This repository contains all the materials for our "Machine learning with biomedical ontologies" manuscript. We provide the Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce our experimental results and the benchmark datasets based on predicting protein-protein interactions.
Furthermore, we make a set of slides available (as PDF and source code in LaTeX Beamer) that may be useful for teaching or presentations.
